title: A scripted b10x run does not require b10x-harness on the PATH
summary: Metaharness::start with a ScriptedRunner refuses to start a Kind::B10x run when b10x-harness is absent from the PATH (Launch refusal at crates/metaharness/src/builder.rs:547), although the scripted runner starts no process; the Gate workflow works around it by installing the binary.

<!-- Starting point for a `story` artifact, seeded by `aep artifact new story <name>`.

# Story: <name>

## Outcome

*What is true for whom once this has shipped, in one sentence. If it names a component rather than a
person, it is a task — say what changes for someone.*

## Context

*Why this is worth doing now, and what it depends on. Link the epic or specification it comes from
rather than restating it; the `derived_from` relation already carries the edge.*

## Acceptance

*The conditions under which this is done, each one something a person or a check can observe. "Works
correctly" is not one of them.*

## Out of Scope

*What a reasonable reader would expect to be included and is not — the boundary that stops this
story quietly becoming an epic.*

## Ambiguities

*Each gap this story found and did not close, classified. `inferable` — the answer is already
written down, so give the `path:line` or the artifact id that settles it.
`requires-stakeholder-input` — nobody here can decide it, so name who does, and raise that entry as
a `decision-blocker` with a `blocks` edge to this story, or it is a sentence somebody improvises
later.*

## Open Questions

*Anything still undecided belongs in `## Ambiguities` above, classified and with its citation or its
decider. Keep this section for a question that is neither — an unowned question is a story that
stalls without anybody noticing.*
