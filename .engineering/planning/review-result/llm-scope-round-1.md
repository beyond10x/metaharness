Read 55 reviewed artifacts: LLM 36, Atlas 3, Harness 5, Metaharness 4, and llmgw 7; additionally consulted two historical Harness evidence artifacts. Ran `aep plan artifact list --format json`, `show`, `graph`, `kinds`, `relations`, and `validate`, and read `llm/docs/design.md` and `atlas/architecture/adr/0063-llm-owns-inference.md`. Extracted 12 foundation and sequencing promises before reading their decomposition; traced all 12 to owning artifacts. All five stores returned `valid`; Atlas and Harness also reported existing advisory warnings.

Could not establish live subscription availability, the future Connectors contract, or deployment ownership; the artifacts explicitly retain these uncertainties and their blockers. Cross-repository dependencies remain documented references with local blocking edges because of the recorded AEP limitation; no machine-resolved cross-store completion is assumed. Runtime correctness and scheduling safety are outside this scope verdict.
