Rechecked the same 55-artifact set: LLM 36, Atlas 3, Harness 5, Metaharness 4, and llmgw 7. Re-read the revised access, provider-account and declaration-domain artifacts through `aep plan artifact show`, inspected `llm/spec/domains/catalog.yaml`, and ran artifact listing, graph inspection, all five store validators, and ESS validation. All 12 previously extracted foundation and sequencing promises remain claimed; the revisions preserve subscription coverage and explicitly represent anonymous endpoints. All validators returned `valid`.

Could not establish live subscription availability, the future Connectors contract, or deployment ownership; these remain explicit blockers. Store validators report the empty first-round scope findings as a missing block; that recording or parser issue requires separate verification and is not a scope finding. Runtime correctness and scheduling safety remain outside this verdict.
