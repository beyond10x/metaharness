Read 55 reviewed artifacts: llm 36, Atlas 3, Harness 5, Metaharness 4, llmgw 7, including its deployment-owner blocker; also inspected linked records outside the set. Re-ran `aep plan artifact show`, `relations`, `graph`, and `validate`, walked 113 relevant edges, and found no dependency cycle. The optional credential reference now represents anonymous bindings while the declaration specification preserves authenticated-mode requirements. `ess specify validate --path spec` returned `llm v1 — 2 file(s), valid`; all five planning stores returned `valid`.

Could not establish machine-resolved cross-repository dependencies because the documented AEP limitation remains; local blockers explicitly gate adoption. Runtime behavior and provider qualification remain future work. Validator warnings concern scope/review records and are outside this design verdict.
