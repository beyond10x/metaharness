specification:declaration-domain — The mandatory Account-to-SecretReference relation cannot represent the anonymous endpoints promised by story:provider-accounts, so model credential-free bindings explicitly and retain required credentials for authenticated bindings — llm/spec/domains/catalog.yaml:28; llm/.engineering/planning/story/provider-accounts.md:17

Read 54 reviewed artifacts: llm 36, Atlas 3, Harness 5, Metaharness 4, llmgw 6; also read three linked Atlas objectives and llmgw’s deployment-owner blocker. Ran `aep plan artifact show`, `relations`, `graph`, and `validate` in each repository; walked 111 relevant edges, including edges outside the reviewed set, and checked all five stores’ dependency/blocking graphs without finding a cycle. All validators returned `valid`; existing Atlas/Harness warnings are not design findings.

Could not establish machine-resolved cross-repository dependencies: the documented AEP limitation remains, and explicit local blockers preserve the intended adoption gate. Runtime behavior and live provider qualification remain future work.
