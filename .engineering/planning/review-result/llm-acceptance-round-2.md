Read all 55 assigned artifacts through `aep plan artifact show`: llm 36, Atlas 3, Harness 5, Metaharness 4, and llmgw 7, including `decision-blocker:deployment-owner-and-cutover-policy`; rechecked the revised `story:anthropic-access`, `story:provider-accounts`, `specification:declaration-domain`, and LLM ESS files, and ran all five store validators plus `ess specify validate --path spec`.

Could not establish runtime behavior, provider access, or live deployment ownership from this scaffold; the artifacts correctly require future evidence. All five stores validate, with validator warnings excluded from acceptance findings; the transient Harness journal mismatch disappeared on recheck. The previous acceptance finding is resolved.
