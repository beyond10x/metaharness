Reassessed the same 55 artifacts: LLM 36, Atlas 3, Harness 5, Metaharness 4 and llmgw 7, using fresh `aep plan artifact list`, `show`, `graph`, `waves` and `validate` results; also read the two historical Harness ownership annotations as context. The 31 implementation stories retain 0 cited, 31 inferred and 0 unplaceable typed surfaces. Revisions introduce no additional concurrency conflict; declared overlaps remain separated.

Limits: inferred module scopes do not establish exact future file changes. Wave output includes blocked stories, so this verdict does not clear release, subscription, Connectors or deployment prerequisites. The two historical Harness stories remain outside the scheduled set. All five stores validate; review-record parser warnings are being handled separately by the caller.
