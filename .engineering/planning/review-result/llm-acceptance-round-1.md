story:anthropic-access — the acceptance permits retaining an unavailable-subscription blocker instead of demonstrating successful API and subscription turns, so require successful qualification for completion and treat the unavailable path as incomplete — llm/.engineering/planning/story/anthropic-access.md:24

Read 54 reviewed artifacts through `aep plan artifact show`: llm 36 (all non-review artifacts), Atlas 3 (`architecture-decision-record:llm-owns-inference`, `initiative:llm-foundation`, `migration-plan:llm-consumer-sequence`), Harness 5 (`dependency-blocker:llm-foundation-release`, `epic:llm-adoption`, `story:llm-cost-adoption`, `story:llm-neutral-interface`, `story:llm-provider-routing`), Metaharness 4 (`dependency-blocker:llm-foundation-release`, `epic:llm-adoption`, `story:llm-route-bindings`, `story:llm-route-evidence`), llmgw 6 (`dependency-blocker:llm-foundation-release`, `epic:llm-adoption`, `specification:existing-gateway-contract`, `story:llm-compatibility`, `story:llm-reversible-cutover`, `story:llmgw-retirement`); additionally read two historical Harness vLLM records as context, the LLM design/specification/scaffold checks, Atlas ADR/workspace, kind lifecycles, and all five store validators.

Could not establish runtime behavior or provider access from this planning scaffold; these appropriately remain future evidence. All five stores validate, with existing Atlas/Harness warnings excluded from findings.
