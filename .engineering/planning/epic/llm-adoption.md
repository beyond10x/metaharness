title: Metaharness uses shared LLM route bindings without changing confinement
revision: 1
---
## Outcome

Metaharness uses shared LLM route bindings without changing confinement.

## Prerequisite

An exact qualified LLM release is required. No runtime code changes as part of this planning delivery. The new domain is owned by llm/spec/system.yaml and its declaration-domain specification; no duplicate entity model is introduced here.

## Evidence

Operator direction 2026-09-19; README.md; AGENTS.md; LLM docs/design.md. Atlas initiative:llm-foundation coordinates the order.

## External prerequisites

- depends_on:llm/story:foundation-qualified
- informed_by:llm/specification:declaration-domain

AEP 0.55.0 currently refuses cross-member targets while creating mutation locator evidence (kind contains disallowed character /). These are explicit references, not admitted graph edges. The local llm-foundation-release blocker gates adoption until the exact upstream release evidence exists.
